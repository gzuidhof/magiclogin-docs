# Introduction

Magic Login is a service that allows you to send **transactional** e-mails with templates and support for **authentication tokens** built-in.

What that means is that you can send e-mails that contain a button \(that is a link to a URL\), and based on the token in this URL you can verify that it was in fact this e-mail's owner that clicked the link.

That's exactly what you need for:

* Passwordless login
* User sign up \(and associated e-mail verification\)
* E-mail confirmation for actions \(e.g. deleting their account, or making other dangerous changes\)
* Password reset e-mails
* E-mail sharing or account invites \(e.g. click link in e-mail to get access to this document\).
