# What kind of e-mails can I send?

Magic Login is a service for **transactional e-mails**. Transactional e-mails are usually triggered by the user or other events, for instance they are sent when the user wishes to log in. 

Examples of **non-transactional** e-mails are newsletters and marketing e-mails. You need to use a different service for those. Examples are [**Substack**](https://substack.com/) or [**buttondown.email**](https://buttondown.email/).

**We have to be strict about this.**

Restricting our service to transactional e-mails only helps us ensure good and fast deliverability.
