# What kind of e-mails can I send?

Magic Login is a service for **transactional e-mails**. Transactional e-mails are usually triggered by the user or other events, for instance they are sent when the user wishes to log in. 

Examples of non-transactional e-mails \(**which Magic Login must not be used for**\) are newsletters and marketing e-mails. You need to use a different service for those, e-mails such as **Substack** or **buttondown.email**.

**We have to be strict about this.** Restricting usage to transactional e-mails helps us ensure good and fast deliverability.
